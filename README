Contains source code for portainer binary bundled with October release of 
Super Container OS https://sourceforge.net/projects/super-container-os/

How to Deploy Portainer without Docker


Download and extract the binary to a location on disk:

$ cd /opt
$ wget https://github.com/portainer/portainer/releases/download/2.0.0/portainer-2.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar xvpfz portainer-2.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
Then just use the portainer binary as you would use CLI flags with Docker.

Note: Portainer will try to write its data into the /data folder by default. You must ensure this folder exists 
first (or change the path it will use via the --data, see below).

$ mkdir /data
$ cd /opt/portainer
$ ./portainer --template-file "${PWD}/templates.json"
You can use the -p flag to serve Portainer on another port:

$ ./portainer -p :8080
You can change the folder used by Portainer to store its data with the --data flag:

$ ./portainer --data /opt/portainer-data

.. raw:: html

    <script type="text/javascript">
    if (String(window.location).indexOf("readthedocs") !== -1) {
        window.location.replace('https://documentation.portainer.io/');
    }
    </script>

All this process is already done so just run portainer as sudo/root in your Super Container OS and point your browser 
to ip addr:9000 with default settings.


Major change is that Kubernetes support has landed! You can now manage the deployment of applications atop Kubernetes clusters 
using the familiar Portainer UX
